# Introduction

Air Force API provides means for level designer to bring "life" into the level.
The level itself is usually designed in [RUBE](https://www.iforce2d.net/rube), it is then exported
to \*.json file and the game loads this \*.json file together with lua script.

You can study other manual topics in order to get better understanding of
game anatomy.
