**1. About**
-------------------
Trigger Time is a story-driven, top-down Shoot'em up with a fun gravity gun and physics puzzles to solve.
Blast your way through 9 levels filled with enemies, hazards and bizarre bosses.
Along the way you'll take control of vehicles, pick up weapons, items and boosters.

**2. Status**
-------------------
This is 100% full source code for the game. However, due to some legal stuff it's not possible to publish some of the in-game
music here on github. Those music files were replaced by "5 minutes of silence" dummy ogg files. If you want to have the
music in game you'll have to install the game from Steam (for free), locate music files and overwrite those dummy oggs. More
on that later.
